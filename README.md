# plugin.video.mixer
Incredibly simplistic mixer stream viewer for Kodi
Tested on Kodi 18.3 and whatever version is running on my raspberry pi.

Download the latest version from here https://github.com/Caliaha/plugin.video.mixer/archive/v0.0.4.zip
After starting up Kodi, go to Addons -> Install from zip file.  You may have to enable unknown sources before you can install it.
